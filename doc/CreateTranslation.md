# Create a new translation

The data cards have only one language. You can use just your lovely language. But the app itself can be translated in different languages. Open the folder

/app/strings/

and copy the folder

/de-DE/

Name the folder like ISO language code. Then edit the i18n.js file.

Currently only German translation is loaded.
